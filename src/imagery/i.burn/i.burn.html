<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
Understanding the spectral variation that vegetation suffers after being 
subjected to a burnt shows that there is a significant reduction of albedo 
in the near infrared region and a small increase of albedo in the shortwave infrared.

<p>
To this aim, some spectral indices were proposed and implemented in this addon, <em>i.burn</em>. 

<p>
Based on this idea, Key & Benson (2006) proposed the spectral index NBR - Normalized Burn Ratio, 
which presents a normalized difference between the NIR and SWIR regions. In the same paper, Key & Benson (2006) 
realized that if they did the difference verification between pre-fire and post-fire NBR, they would be able to 
verify the severity of the burn and proposed the dNBR or differenced normalized burn ratio. 

<p>
Also in 2006, Roy et al. assessed the performance of the NBR.
In 2007, Miller & Thode observed that the NBR field verification presented some classes of lower severity overestimated 
and those of higher severity, underestimated or even non-existent. Thinking of solving the problem they proposed the RdNBR 
or Relative dNBR, through normalization from pre-fire data.

<p>
In 2016, Teobaldo and Baptista adjust the dNBR and RdNBR to investigate the efficiency of regrowth, proposing the dNBR regrowth 
and RdNBR regrowth, from replacing the NBRpre-fire by the NBRpost-fire and the NBRpost-fire by what they called the NBRregrowth  
with a post-burn period, in order to verify the recomposition of the vegetation, in both indices.

<p>
The i.burn's purpose is calculates burn severity area and the regrowth efficiency from Landsat/Sentinel images.


<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
<em>i.burn</em> i.burn works with sensor systems that image the NIR and SWIR bands, such as Landsat OLI bands 5 and 7 or Sentinel 2 bands 8A and 12. 
Preferably use surface reflectance data, but studies can be performed with TOA radiance and reflectance data as well as DN data.
